# stm32f10x
A simple to use framework for the STM32F10x series of ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

The goal is to add modules to this framework in an order of (in my opinion) fundamental to more advanced over time.  Initially, the development will be done using C, but over time classes will be added.  Users should be able to use either to get whatever they need to done.  The initial hardware being used for development is the Blue Pill STM32F103 microcontroller based module.
